List of imporvements I have in the pipe for Fapws:
The list is not exhaustive, but more or less sorted from most important to less (to my eyes)

- Better manage POST of big files. They should not be kept in memory before treatment
- maybe add sample in the Manifest (for Pypi) recursive-include sample *
- Better documentation
- be compliant with HTTP1.1
